## About Smoke

[Smoke.io](https://smoke.io) is a decentralized Cannabis social network which operates on top of the Smoke blockchain.

Smoke users can reward one another influence tokens (smoke power) which give you more control over post payouts and allow you to earn on curation rewards.

Smoke was forked from the [Steem](https://steemit.com/) codebase and innovated upon to create a decentralized safe haven for Cannabis consumers, reviewers, patients, etc from the ever increasing hostilities centralized social media has imposed on Cannabis communities in recent years.

SMOKE is tradeable and can be transferred anywhere at anytime.

SMOKE can be converted to SMOKE POWER in a process called powering up.

SMOKE is mainly traded on the Bitshares DEX through the RUDEX.SMOKE gateway token.
